When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You want a remote repository as a precaution against catastrophic loss in your local systems.  Also, if you're working on multiple systems/sites, or if you have multiple people doing development, then access to your local systems aren't required.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want to bring in changes until you're at a good integration point with your local work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is a GitHub specific operation.  It's used to create your own repository which is connected with an existing repository on GitHub
    clone is a duplication of an existing respository, both of which can either be on the same or different systems.
    branch is on a specific repository, and is used for various lines of development

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    After the fetch or pull is done, merging can be done locally without a network connection to GitHub.  It will also be faster since all of the changes are stored locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    There would need to be local shared storage to place the changes desired, then manual communication between team members to indicate changes, along with manual diffing of files, review, and feedback.  It's highly labor intensive.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you're collaborating with others, doing your work in a branch and then submitting it for merging to main via a push request allows for code reviewing by the other collaborators.  This also allows for testing of your changes by others to provide quality assurance that the master branch won't be broken by a submission.
