When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You want a remote repository as a precaution against catastrophic loss in your local systems.  Also, if you're working on multiple systems/sites, or if you have multiple people doing development, then access to your local systems aren't required.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want to bring in changes until you're at a good integration point with your local work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is a GitHub specific operation.  It's used to create your own repository which is connected with an existing repository on GitHub
    clone is a duplication of an existing respository, both of which can either be on the same or different systems.
    branch is on a specific repository, and is used for various lines of development
